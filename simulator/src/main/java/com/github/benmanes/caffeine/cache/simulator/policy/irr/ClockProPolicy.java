/**
 * The ClockPro algorithm. This algorithm differs from LIRS by replacing the LRU stacks with Clock
 * (Second Chance) policy. This allows cache hits to be performed concurrently at the cost of a
 * global lock on a miss and a worst case O(n) eviction when the queue is scanned.
 * <p>
 * ClockPro uses three hands that scan the queue. The hot hand points to the largest recency, the
 * cold hand to the cold entry furthest from the hot hand, and the test hand to the last cold entry
 * in the test period. This policy is adaptive by adjusting the percentage of hot and cold entries
 * that may reside in the cache. It uses non-resident (ghost) entries to retain additional history,
 * which are removed during the test hand's scan. The algorithm is explained by the authors in
 * <a href="http://www.ece.eng.wayne.edu/~sjiang/pubs/papers/jiang05_CLOCK-Pro.pdf">CLOCK-Pro: An
 * Effective Improvement of the CLOCK Replacement</a> and
 * <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/huliang64/clockpro">Clock-Pro: An Effective Replacement in OS
 * Kernel</a>.
 * <p>
 * This implementation is based on
 * <a href="https://bitbucket.org/SamiLehtinen/pyclockpro">PyClockPro</a> by Sami Lehtinen,
 * available under the MIT license.
