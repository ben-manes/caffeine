  /*
   * This class maintains a 4-bit CountMinSketch [1] with periodic aging to provide the popularity
   * history for the TinyLfu admission policy [2]. The time and space efficiency of the sketch
   * allows it to cheaply estimate the frequency of an entry in a stream of cache access events.
   *
   * The counter matrix is represented as a single-dimensional array holding 16 counters per slot. A
   * fixed depth of four balances the accuracy and cost, resulting in a width of four times the
   * length of the array. To retain an accurate estimation, the array's length equals the maximum
   * number of entries in the cache, increased to the closest power-of-two to exploit more efficient
   * bit masking. This configuration results in a confidence of 93.75% and an error bound of
   * e / width.
   *
   * To improve hardware efficiency, an item's counters are constrained to a 64-byte block, which is
   * the size of an L1 cache line. This differs from the theoretical ideal where counters are
   * uniformly distributed to minimize collisions. In that configuration, the memory accesses are
   * not predictable and lack spatial locality, which may cause the pipeline to need to wait for
   * four memory loads. Instead, the items are uniformly distributed to blocks, and each counter is
   * uniformly selected from a distinct 16-byte segment. While the runtime memory layout may result
   * in the blocks not being cache-aligned, the L2 spatial prefetcher tries to load aligned pairs of
   * cache lines, so the typical cost is only one memory access.
   *
   * The frequency of all entries is aged periodically using a sampling window based on the maximum
   * number of entries in the cache. This is referred to as the reset operation by TinyLfu and keeps
   * the sketch fresh by dividing all counters by two and subtracting based on the number of odd
   * counters found. The O(n) cost of aging is amortized, ideal for hardware prefetching, and uses
   * inexpensive bit manipulations per array location.
