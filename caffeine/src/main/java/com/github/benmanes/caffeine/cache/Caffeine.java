/**
 * A builder of {@link Cache}, {@link LoadingCache}, {@link AsyncCache}, and
 * {@link AsyncLoadingCache} instances having a combination of the following features:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>automatic loading of entries into the cache, optionally asynchronously
 *   <li>size-based eviction when a maximum is exceeded based on frequency and recency
 *   <li>time-based expiration of entries, measured since last access or last write
 *   <li>asynchronously refresh when the first stale request for an entry occurs
 *   <li>keys automatically wrapped in {@linkplain WeakReference weak} references
 *   <li>values automatically wrapped in {@linkplain WeakReference weak} or
 *       {@linkplain SoftReference soft} references
 *   <li>writes propagated to an external resource
 *   <li>notification of evicted (or otherwise removed) entries
 *   <li>accumulation of cache access statistics
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * These features are all optional; caches can be created using all or none of them. By default
 * cache instances created by {@code Caffeine} will not perform any type of eviction.
 * <p>
 * Usage example:
 * <pre>{@code
 *   LoadingCache<Key, Graph> graphs = Caffeine.newBuilder()
 *       .maximumSize(10_000)
 *       .expireAfterWrite(Duration.ofMinutes(10))
 *       .removalListener((Key key, Graph graph, RemovalCause cause) ->
 *           System.out.printf("Key %s was removed (%s)%n", key, cause))
 *       .build(key -> createExpensiveGraph(key));
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * The returned cache is implemented as a hash table with similar performance characteristics to
 * {@link ConcurrentHashMap}. The {@code asMap} view (and its collection views) have <i>weakly
 * consistent iterators</i>. This means that they are safe for concurrent use, but if other threads
 * modify the cache after the iterator is created, it is undefined which of these changes, if any,
 * are reflected in that iterator. These iterators never throw
 * {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> by default, the returned cache uses equality comparisons (the
 * {@link Object#equals equals} method) to determine equality for keys or values. However, if
 * {@link #weakKeys} was specified, the cache uses identity ({@code ==}) comparisons instead for
 * keys. Likewise, if {@link #weakValues} or {@link #softValues} was specified, the cache uses
 * identity comparisons for values.
 * <p>
 * Entries are automatically evicted from the cache when any of
 * {@linkplain #maximumSize(long) maximumSize}, {@linkplain #maximumWeight(long) maximumWeight},
 * {@linkplain #expireAfter(Expiry) expireAfter}, {@linkplain #expireAfterWrite expireAfterWrite},
 * {@linkplain #expireAfterAccess expireAfterAccess}, {@linkplain #weakKeys weakKeys},
 * {@linkplain #weakValues weakValues}, or {@linkplain #softValues softValues} are requested.
 * <p>
 * If {@linkplain #maximumSize(long) maximumSize} or {@linkplain #maximumWeight(long) maximumWeight}
 * is requested entries may be evicted on each cache modification.
 * <p>
 * If {@linkplain #expireAfter(Expiry) expireAfter},
 * {@linkplain #expireAfterWrite expireAfterWrite}, or
 * {@linkplain #expireAfterAccess expireAfterAccess} is requested then entries may be evicted on
 * each cache modification, on occasional cache accesses, or on calls to {@link Cache#cleanUp}. A
 * {@linkplain #scheduler(Scheduler)} may be specified to provide prompt removal of expired entries
 * rather than waiting until activity triggers the periodic maintenance. Expired entries may be
 * counted by {@link Cache#estimatedSize()}, but will never be visible to read or write operations.
 * <p>
 * If {@linkplain #weakKeys weakKeys}, {@linkplain #weakValues weakValues}, or
 * {@linkplain #softValues softValues} are requested, it is possible for a key or value present in
 * the cache to be reclaimed by the garbage collector. Entries with reclaimed keys or values may be
 * removed from the cache on each cache modification, on occasional cache accesses, or on calls to
 * {@link Cache#cleanUp}; such entries may be counted in {@link Cache#estimatedSize()}, but will
 * never be visible to read or write operations.
 * <p>
 * Certain cache configurations will result in the accrual of periodic maintenance tasks which
 * will be performed during write operations, or during occasional read operations in the absence of
 * writes. The {@link Cache#cleanUp} method of the returned cache will also perform maintenance, but
 * calling it should not be necessary with a high throughput cache. Only caches built with
 * {@linkplain #maximumSize maximumSize}, {@linkplain #maximumWeight maximumWeight},
 * {@linkplain #expireAfter(Expiry) expireAfter}, {@linkplain #expireAfterWrite expireAfterWrite},
 * {@linkplain #expireAfterAccess expireAfterAccess}, {@linkplain #weakKeys weakKeys},
 * {@linkplain #weakValues weakValues}, or {@linkplain #softValues softValues} perform periodic
 * maintenance.
 * <p>
 * The caches produced by {@code Caffeine} are serializable, and the deserialized caches retain all
 * the configuration properties of the original cache. Note that the serialized form does <i>not</i>
 * include cache contents, but only configuration.
