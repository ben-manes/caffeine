abstract class StripedBuffer<E> implements Buffer<E> {
  /*
   * This class maintains a lazily-initialized table of atomically updated buffers. The table size
   * is a power of two. Indexing uses masked per-thread hash codes. Nearly all declarations in this
   * class are package-private, accessed directly by subclasses.
   *
   * Table entries are of class Buffer and should be padded to reduce cache contention. Padding is
   * overkill for most atomics because they are usually irregularly scattered in memory and thus
   * don't interfere much with each other. But Atomic objects residing in arrays will tend to be
   * placed adjacent to each other, and so will most often share cache lines (with a huge negative
   * performance impact) without this precaution.
   *
   * In part because Buffers are relatively large, we avoid creating them until they are needed.
   * When there is no contention, all updates are made to a single buffer. Upon contention (a failed
   * CAS inserting into the buffer), the table is expanded to size 2. The table size is doubled upon
   * further contention until reaching the nearest power of two greater than or equal to the number
   * of CPUS. Table slots remain empty (null) until they are needed.
   *
   * A single spinlock ("tableBusy") is used for initializing and resizing the table, as well as
   * populating slots with new Buffers. There is no need for a blocking lock; when the lock is not
   * available, threads try other slots. During these retries, there is increased contention and
   * reduced locality, which is still better than alternatives.
   *
   * The Thread probe fields maintained via ThreadLocalRandom serve as per-thread hash codes. We let
   * them remain uninitialized as zero (if they come in this way) until they contend at slot 0. They
   * are then initialized to values that typically do not often conflict with others. Contention
   * and/or table collisions are indicated by failed CASes when performing an update operation. Upon
   * a collision, if the table size is less than the capacity, it is doubled in size unless some
   * other thread holds the lock. If a hashed slot is empty, and lock is available, a new Buffer is
   * created. Otherwise, if the slot exists, a CAS is tried. Retries proceed by "double hashing",
   * using a secondary hash (Marsaglia XorShift) to try to find a free slot.
   *
   * The table size is capped because, when there are more threads than CPUs, supposing that each
   * thread were bound to a CPU, there would exist a perfect hash function mapping threads to slots
   * that eliminates collisions. When we reach capacity, we search for this mapping by randomly
   * varying the hash codes of colliding threads. Because search is random, and collisions only
   * become known via CAS failures, convergence can be slow, and because threads are typically not
   * bound to CPUS forever, may not occur at all. However, despite these limitations, observed
   * contention rates are typically low in these cases.
   *
   * It is possible for a Buffer to become unused when threads that once hashed to it terminate, as
   * well as in the case where doubling the table causes no thread to hash to it under expanded
   * mask. We do not try to detect or remove buffers, under the assumption that for long-running
   * instances, observed contention levels will recur, so the buffers will eventually be needed
   * again; and for short-lived ones, it does not matter.
