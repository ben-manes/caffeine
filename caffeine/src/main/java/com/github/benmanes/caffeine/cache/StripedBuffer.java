 * buffers in order to minimize memory usage for caches that are not heavily contended on.

abstract class StripedBuffer<E> implements Buffer<E> {
  /*
   * This class maintains a lazily-initialized table of atomically updated buffers. The table size
   * is a power of two. Indexing uses masked per-thread hash codes. Nearly all declarations in this
   * class are package-private, accessed directly by subclasses.
   *
   * Table entries are of class Buffer and should be padded to reduce cache contention. Padding is
   * overkill for most atomics because they are usually irregularly scattered in memory and thus
   * don't interfere much with each other. But Atomic objects residing in arrays will tend to be
   * placed adjacent to each other, and so will most often share cache lines (with a huge negative
   * performance impact) without this precaution.
   *
   * In part because Buffers are relatively large, we avoid creating them until they are needed.
   * When there is no contention, all updates are made to a single buffer. Upon contention (a failed
   * CAS inserting into the buffer), the table is expanded to size 2. The table size is doubled upon
   * further contention until reaching the nearest power of two greater than or equal to the number
   * of CPUS. Table slots remain empty (null) until they are needed.
   *
   * A single spinlock ("tableBusy") is used for initializing and resizing the table, as well as
   * populating slots with new Buffers. There is no need for a blocking lock; when the lock is not
   * available, threads try other slots. During these retries, there is increased contention and
   * reduced locality, which is still better than alternatives.
   *
   * Contention and/or table collisions are indicated by failed CASes when performing an update
   * operation. Upon a collision, if the table size is less than the capacity, it is doubled in size
   * unless some other thread holds the lock. If a hashed slot is empty, and lock is available, a
   * new Buffer is created. Otherwise, if the slot exists, a CAS is tried. The thread id serves as
   * the base for per-thread hash codes. Retries proceed by "incremental hashing", using the top
   * half of the seed to increment the bottom half which is used as a probe to try to find a free
   * slot.
   *
   * The table size is capped because, when there are more threads than CPUs, supposing that each
   * thread were bound to a CPU, there would exist a perfect hash function mapping threads to slots
   * that eliminates collisions. When we reach capacity, we search for this mapping by varying the
   * hash codes of colliding threads. Because search is random, and collisions only become known via
   * CAS failures, convergence can be slow, and because threads are typically not bound to CPUs
   * forever, may not occur at all. However, despite these limitations, observed contention rates
   * are typically low in these cases.
   *
   * It is possible for a Buffer to become unused when threads that once hashed to it terminate, as
   * well as in the case where doubling the table causes no thread to hash to it under expanded
   * mask. We do not try to detect or remove buffers, under the assumption that for long-running
   * instances, observed contention levels will recur, so the buffers will eventually be needed
   * again; and for short-lived ones, it does not matter.
