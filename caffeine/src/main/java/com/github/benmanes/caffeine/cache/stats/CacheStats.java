/**
 * Statistics about the performance of a {@link Cache}.
 * <p>
 * Cache statistics are incremented according to the following rules:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>When a cache lookup encounters an existing cache entry {@code hitCount} is incremented.
 *   <li>When a cache lookup first encounters a missing cache entry, a new entry is loaded.
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>After successfully loading an entry {@code missCount} and {@code loadSuccessCount} are
 *         incremented, and the total loading time, in nanoseconds, is added to
 *         {@code totalLoadTime}.
 *     <li>When an exception is thrown while loading an entry, {@code missCount} and {@code
 *         loadFailureCount} are incremented, and the total loading time, in nanoseconds, is
 *         added to {@code totalLoadTime}.
 *     <li>Cache lookups that encounter a missing cache entry that is still loading will wait
 *         for loading to complete (whether successful or not) and then increment {@code missCount}.
 *   </ul>
 *   <li>When an entry is computed through the {@linkplain Cache#asMap asMap} the
 *       {@code loadSuccessCount} or {@code loadFailureCount} is incremented.
 *   <li>When an entry is evicted from the cache, {@code evictionCount} is incremented and the
 *       weight added to {@code evictionWeight}.
 *   <li>No stats are modified when a cache entry is invalidated or manually removed.
 *   <li>No stats are modified by non-computing operations invoked on the
 *       {@linkplain Cache#asMap asMap} view of the cache.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A lookup is specifically defined as an invocation of one of the methods
 * {@link LoadingCache#get(Object)}, {@link Cache#get(Object, java.util.function.Function)}, or
 * {@link LoadingCache#getAll(Iterable)}.
 * <p>
 * This is a <em>value-based</em> class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference
 * equality ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of {@code CacheStats}
 * may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
