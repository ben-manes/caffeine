/**
 * A listener registered for notification when an entry is evicted. An instance
 * may be called concurrently by multiple threads to process entries. An
 * implementation should avoid performing blocking calls or synchronizing on
 * shared resources.
 * <p>
 * The listener is invoked by {@link ConcurrentLinkedHashMap} on a caller's
 * thread and will not block other threads from operating on the map. An
 * implementation should be aware that the caller's thread will not expect
 * long execution times or failures as a side effect of the listener being
 * notified. Execution safety and a fast turn around time can be achieved by
 * performing the operation asynchronously, such as by submitting a task to an
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService}.
